## About
DIYbio.org was founded in 2008 with the mission of establishing a vibrant, productive and safe community of DIY biologists.  Central to our mission is the belief that biotechnology and greater public understanding about it has the potential to benefit everyone.

## History
DIYbio was founded in 2008 by Jason Bobe and Mackenzie Cowell. The first [public meet-up](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/diybio/HgjipjqxEvs/kiZdLNfokJsJ) was held May 1, 2008 at Asgard's pub in Cambridge MA. Many of the attendees are [listed here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/diybio/HgjipjqxEvs/3DP3Gp-ChmQJ). In 2015, DIYbio.org formally became a 501c3 charity in the United States.
